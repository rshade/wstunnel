# Project Structure Guide

This project is organized as follows:

- The main entry point is [main.go](mdc:main.go).
- Core tunnel functionality is implemented in the [tunnel/](mdc:tunnel) directory, with the main client and server logic in [wstuncli.go](mdc:tunnel/wstuncli.go) and [wstunsrv.go](mdc:tunnel/wstunsrv.go).
- The [whois/](mdc:whois) directory contains WHOIS-related utilities, including [robowhois.go](mdc:whois/robowhois.go).
- The [init/](mdc:init) directory contains configuration and init scripts for tunnel components.
- Project configuration and dependencies are managed in [go.mod](mdc:go.mod) and [go.sum](mdc:go.sum).
- Build and release configuration is in [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) and [.goreleaser.yml](mdc:.goreleaser.yml).
- See [README.md](mdc:README.md) for an overview and usage instructions.
